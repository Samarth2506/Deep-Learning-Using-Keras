# Deep-Learning-Using-Keras
Understand the basics of deep learning using Keras Sequential and Functional API. The content assumes a base of Machine Learning. The idea is to organize the scripts to implement Keras while building an inuition of deep learning in parallel.

## Part 1 : Understand the basics of Deep Learning 

Part 1 covers the important concepts including the importance of the choice of loss functions, optimizers and metrics. 

Next, a simple Sequential model is built in Keras for sentiment anaysis of the IMDB reviews data set. The focus is to understand the Keras layout in general from importing data, compiling and finally fitting the model.

Finally, strategies to battle overfitting, a common problem in Deep Learning are investigated and implemented in Python.
